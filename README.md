Ruby (Used for initial, non B+ tree stages of project)

The initial stages of this project were completed using Ruby programs.
Run 'ruby/transform_records_program.rb' to transform the initial data files into files matching our models for this data.

Run 'ruby/sort_records_program.rb' to sort the rows generated by the above program. The first argument to this program should be the "table" to sort (either 'user' or 'message'). The second argument should be the 'row' (field) by which to sort (e.g. 'name' or 'day'). A sample command would like this: "ruby ruby/sort_records_program.rb user city", which would sort all users by lexigraphical order of city.
